# Borealis
Introduction: Borealis is a course registration system.
The test account is bob and his password is 4350.

We also have other accounts for testing purposes:
userName: alice   password: 4350
userName: frank   password: 4350

Selenium Acceptance Tests:
can be run from the Selenium IDE plugin in firefox browser. The tests are found in the "SeleniumATs" folder of the web app.
Exporting these tests to jUnit work, however just including the selenium jar files into our project results in unknown errors with our web app, so we have not included the exported selenium jUnit tests.
